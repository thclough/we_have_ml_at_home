While the name of this repo indicates that the functionality of its contents are highly unlikely to reach the level of the popular machine learning (ML) libraries today, this repo serves as a valuable exercise. It contains the ML algorithms that I write from scratch, where "scratch" means that the highest level of abstraction is numpy (and may become lower when I become better at C). Today, a person who knows a few lines of Python has years of machine learning abstraction at their fingertips through tools such as sklearn, TensorFlow/Keras, etc. So what is the point in learning the inner working of ML models? Yes, to drive a car, you don't need to know how to build an engine. But for those of us who recursively ask "why?" in order to seek debilitating confusion, a superficial understanding simply does not suffice. For me, and maybe you too, ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is fear. Especially when this ignorance masks a tool as powerful as ML. During generative AI's rise, it has presented to many of us who approach life with even a twinge of paranoia as a sort of dark art. Who knows what the sorcerers ~~at OpenAI~~ in China are concocting at this very moment? It's time for me to cure, or at the least rationalize, this fear with knowledge, and the most potent forms of knowledge are implementation and creation. Let's get working ...
